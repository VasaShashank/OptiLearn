# OptiTeach: Intelligent Course-Planning & Curriculum Assistant

> **"DBMS is the core. AI and optimization are the intelligence. The dashboard is the product."**

OptiTeach is a course-planning and curriculum optimization assistant engineered for university faculty. A teacher faces a rigid syllabus and a finite calendar of class hours. OptiTeach helps them solve four fundamental instructional challenges:

1. **What to teach next:** Determining optimal sequence and identifying bottleneck prerequisites.
2. **How much time each topic deserves:** Allocating semester minutes mathematically using Operations Research (Mixed-Integer Linear Programming).
3. **How to teach it:** Recommending pedagogical methods (lecture, worked examples, inquiry, group discussion) based on concept typology and empirical efficacy.
4. **Whether to revise first:** Dynamically recommending prerequisite revision when student assessment scores fall below cognitive mastery thresholds.

OptiTeach deliberately operates at the **course, topic, and concept level**, rather than acting as a student attendance tracker or administrative ERP.

## 🧭 The Teacher's Journey: End-to-End Workflow

The platform operates on a closed pedagogical feedback loop:  
**Plan → Teach → Assess → Record → Analyze → Re-optimize**

```

### 1. Create a Course & Upload the Syllabus
The teacher configures a course (e.g., *CS355 Advanced Algorithms*, 45 periods of 1 hour / 60 minutes) and uploads the syllabus as a PDF or raw text. The **deterministic NLP engine** (`app/nlp/deterministic.py`) extracts:
- Course name, code, and total syllabus duration (e.g., `Total Hours : 45L` -> 45 periods).
- Units and modules with clean titles and hour detachment.
- Topics and atomic concepts with cognitive difficulty (1–5) and typology.
- Course Outcomes (COs) mapped to **Bloom's Taxonomy** levels (*Remember*, *Understand*, *Apply*, *Analyze*, *Evaluate*, *Create*).
- Initial prerequisite Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) dependencies.
- *Strict Rule: NLP proposes, teacher confirms.* The teacher reviews and adjusts the draft before committing to the database.

### 2. The Curriculum Graph & Bottleneck Detection
Concepts are assembled into an in-memory and database-backed **knowledge graph** (using NetworkX and recursive SQL CTEs). The system highlights **curriculum bottlenecks**: concepts that are heavily depended upon by subsequent units where student performance is lagging.

### 3. Course-Level Time Allocation (Optimizer Level 1)
The total semester duration (e.g., $45 \times 60 = 2700$ minutes) is partitioned using **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (SciPy MILP)**:
- Reserves 10% for revision and 8% for formal assessments.
- Solves a discrete optimization problem balancing concept difficulty, importance weight, prerequisite depth, and real-time student mastery.
- Flags time pressure (e.g., *"9 topics remaining with only 7 periods available"*).

### 4. Class-Level Phase Planning (Optimizer Level 2)
For each individual 1-hour period (60 minutes), OptiTeach constructs a minute-by-minute phase schedule:
- **Standard 60-Minute Period**: 5 min recap, 25 min explanation/lecture, 20 min worked examples, 10 min quiz/active check ($5+25+20+10 = 60$).
- **Revision 60-Minute Period (when prerequisite $< 60\%$)**: 10 min targeted revision, 20 min explanation, 20 min worked examples, 10 min guided practice ($10+20+20+10 = 60$).
- Phases strictly sum to the period duration (60 minutes).
- **Pedagogical Advisor**: Suggests teaching methods tailored to the concept's cognitive category and historical effectiveness.
- Provides explicit, transparent pedagogical rationales for every recommendation.

### 5. The "Next Class" Dashboard Card
Upon logging in, the instructor is greeted with immediate, actionable context:
> *"Good afternoon, Prof. Turing. Next up: Dynamic Programming: Matrix-Chain Multiplication. Revise Recursion Trees for 10 minutes first. Reason: student assessment average was 54.2%, below the 60% mastery threshold."*
Offers one-click actions: **Prepare my class**, **Launch Presenter Mode**, or **Record this class**.

### 6. Lesson Plans & Versioned Teaching Artifacts
Generates comprehensive lesson plans containing objectives, phase breakdowns, worked examples, interactive activities, common student misconceptions, and Bloom-aligned quiz questions.
- Instructors can **Approve, Edit, or Reject** plans.
- Every modification creates a new immutable version in MongoDB with diff inspection and audit logging.

### 7. Teach, Record, and Close the Loop
After class, the instructor logs actual delivery: minutes spent, teaching methods utilized, student engagement rating (1–5), topics covered, and carry-over status for unfinished topics.

### 8. Assessment & Real-Time Re-Optimization
The teacher inputs quiz and assignment marks per concept. OptiTeach recalculates concept health scores (*Strong*, *Moderate*, *Weak*, *Bottleneck*), updates course velocity, and **immediately adapts upcoming lesson plans and time allocations**.

## 👥 User Roles, Permissions & Account Creation

OptiTeach enforces strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and row-level multi-tenancy:

| Role / Scope | Access Level & Capabilities | Course Boundary & Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Admin** (`admin`) | Institutional supervisor / department chair. Can view all courses across all faculty, inspect institution-wide attainment metrics, audit logs, and system settings. | Global visibility across all courses and instructors. |
| **Teacher** (`teacher`) | Course instructor. Creates courses, uploads syllabi, edits curriculum DAGs, approves lesson plans, and enters assessment marks. | Strictly isolated to owned courses (`teacher_id`) and courses where explicitly added as a member. Other courses return `404 Not Found` (anti-enumeration defense). |
| **Co-Teacher** (`editor`) | Collaborating faculty or lab instructor. Has read and write permissions to edit lesson plans, record sessions, and enter marks. | Granted per-course by the course owner via `course_members`. |
| **Viewer** (`viewer`) | Teaching assistant, auditor, or observer. Has read-only permissions (`GET` requests allowed; any `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` returns `403 Forbidden`). | Granted per-course by the course owner via `course_members`. |

### Account Creation & Registration
- **Faculty Self-Registration**: Available via the frontend `/register` interface or the API endpoint `POST /api/auth/register`.
  - Accepts `email`, `password`, `full_name`, `department`, `designation`, and `employee_id`.
  - Self-registration **strictly assigns the `teacher` role** and automatically provisions a linked `Teacher` profile in the relational schema. Self-registration can never grant administrative privileges.
- **Admin Account Provisioning**: System administrators are established during database initialization (`python -m database.seed.seed_data`) or promoted directly within the database by setting `role = 'admin'` in the `users` table.
- **Authentication Lifecycle**:
  - Secure password hashing using **bcrypt** (work factor 12) with per-user salt.
  - Legacy SHA-256 password hashes are automatically upgraded to bcrypt upon successful login.
  - Short-lived **JWT bearer tokens** (HS256) encode user identity, role, and permissions.
  - Brute-force protection: IP and email-based login throttling via in-memory rate limiting.

## 🧠 The Deterministic NLP Engine (`backend/app/nlp/deterministic.py`)

Unlike fragile generative AI extractors that suffer from hallucinations, non-deterministic output, and network latency, OptiTeach utilizes an **auditable, deterministic, rule-based NLP pipeline**:

```
 Raw Syllabus Text / PDF
          │
          ▼
 1. Unicode & Whitespace Normalization (Dashes, ligatures, zero-width chars)
          │
          ▼
 2. Course Name & Code Extraction (e.g., CS355TBB, Advanced Algorithms)
          │
          ▼
 3. Strict Boundary Detection & Post-Unit Cutoff (Slices before References/Rubrics)
          │
          ▼
 4. Multi-Unit & Module Recognition (Roman, Arabic, Word numerals)
          │
          ▼
 5. Wrapped-Line Unwrapping (_merge_wrapped_lines for mid-sentence breaks)
          │
          ▼
 6. Topic Parsing & Concept Atomic Splitting
          │
          ▼
 7. Concept Classification, Difficulty Scoring & Prerequisite DAG Linking
          │
          ▼
 8. Bloom's Taxonomy Course Outcome (CO) Extraction
```

### Key Technical Innovations in `deterministic.py`
1. **Unicode Dash & Punctuation Normalization**: Standardizes em-dashes (`—`), en-dashes (`–`), minus signs (`−`), horizontal bars (`―`), and smart quotes into canonical ASCII representations.
2. **Multi-Unit Roman & Word Numeral Recognition**: Parses `Unit-I`, `Unit – II`, `UNIT 3:`, `MODULE IV`, `CHAPTER 5`, `Part One` through `ROMAN_MAP` and `WORD_MAP` lookup tables.
3. **Inline Hours Detachment**: Strips administrative time notations such as `09 Hrs`, `(8 Hours)`, `10 Periods`, `45L` from unit headings and topic clauses without corrupting subject titles.
4. **Intelligent Wrapped-Line Joining (`_merge_wrapped_lines`)**: Indian university syllabus documents frequently break sentences across newlines mid-clause (e.g., `Decreasing a key and \n deleting a node`, or `Johnson's Algorithm for sparse \n graphs`). The parser identifies lowercase continuations and trailing conjunctions/prepositions (`and`, `or`, `for`, `with`, `of`) and merges them into unified semantic clauses.
5. **Strict Post-Unit Boundary Cutoff**: Stops unit parsing prior to trailing non-curricular sections:
   - `Course Outcomes` / `CO 1..n`
   - `Reference Books` / `Textbooks` / `Suggested Readings`
   - `Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE)` / `SEE Rubrics` / `Question Paper Pattern`  
   *This ensures Unit V cleanly ends at its actual concepts and does not absorb reference lists or marking rubrics.*
6. **Bloom's Taxonomy Classification**: Course Outcomes (`CO 1`, `CO 2`...) are extracted into the `course_outcomes` table with automated cognitive verb mapping (*Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create*).
7. **Prerequisite DAG Synthesis**: Chained sequential dependencies are generated between atomic concepts within topics, outputting a valid Directed Acyclic Graph.
8. **Strict Zero-Hallucination Guarantee**: If unit headers or topics cannot be parsed, the parser raises an explicit `ValueError` guiding the user rather than fabricating artificial placeholder curriculum data.

## 🏛️ The Relational & Document DBMS Core (The Graded Core)

OptiTeach is built around an enterprise database architecture demonstrated live on the **DBMS Showcase page** with 9 interactive tabs:

| DBMS Category | Architecture & Technical Implementation in OptiTeach |
|---|---|
| **ER Model** | 22 normalized entities; the interactive Mermaid ER diagram is dynamically generated directly from the live database catalog and foreign key constraints. |
| **Relational Schema** | Primary keys, 27 foreign keys, 15 unique constraints, and 40 check constraints managed through versioned, reversible **Alembic migrations** (`0001_initial_schema` to `0005_co_teaching`). |
| **Normalization** | Identified and resolved real-world 1NF violations (multi-valued comma-separated lists migrated to `concept_prerequisites`) and derived attribute violations (converted to generated computed column `total_available_minutes`). Complete functional dependency mapping ensures 3NF / BCNF compliance. |
| **Advanced SQL** | 19 live SQL query demonstrations featuring multi-table `INNER`/`LEFT JOIN`s, `GROUP BY ... HAVING`, recursive Common Table Expressions (`WITH RECURSIVE` for prerequisite graphs), window functions (`RANK()`, `LAG()`, cumulative running sums), relational division, and `EXCEPT` operations. Each query renders its live query execution plan (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`). |
| **Database Objects** | 3 relational views, 1 materialized view (`mv_course_analytics`), 10 custom functions, 1 stored procedure (`archive_completed_course`), and 18 triggers (automated audit logging, real-time student weakness flags, and prerequisite cycle prevention). |
| **Transactions & ACID** | Multi-step curriculum operations execute within strict ACID transactions featuring row-level locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), transaction savepoints, and version-checked concurrency. The **Transaction Lab** demonstrates live rollbacks, isolation levels (`READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, `SERIALIZABLE`), lost-update mitigation, and deadlock resolution across concurrent connections. |
| **Security & Privacy** | bcrypt password hashing, JWT bearer tokens, least-privilege connection roles (`optiteach_app` role restricted from DDL and `TRUNCATE`), immutable `SECURITY DEFINER` audit logs, and **Row-Level Security (RLS)** in the interactive SQL console ensuring faculty cannot query other instructors' records. |
| **Document NoSQL (MongoDB)** | MongoDB 8 houses semi-structured, deeply nested, versioned documents: lesson plan drafts and historical revisions, curriculum DAG graph snapshots, and raw syllabus uploads. Enforces JSON Schema validators, unique and compound indexes, TTL automatic draft expiry, and aggregation analytics pipelines. |
| **Cross-Store Consistency** | A hybrid coordinator verifies referential integrity between PostgreSQL entity IDs and MongoDB document references, providing an automated detection and reconciliation utility. |

### Why a Polyglot Persistence Architecture?
- **PostgreSQL 17**: Enforces relational integrity, foreign key cascades, complex joins, mathematical aggregation, and ACID constraints for core academic records (courses, units, topics, concepts, outcomes, assessment marks).
- **MongoDB 8**: Efficiently stores and versions polymorphic, deeply nested documents (lesson plans with variable pedagogical phases, multimedia resources, and graph snapshots) that are read and updated atomically.
